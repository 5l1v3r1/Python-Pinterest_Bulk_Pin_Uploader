# Python-Pinterest_Bulk_Pin_Uploader
Uploading pins(individual images) from a desktop folder to a specific pinterest board is a tidious process as you have the privilage
only to upload the pins one after the other, this is tidious and time consuming...

what if somone else does that work for you? will that be cool!!...

Using python and selenium this project will be able to upload the files of format(.jpg, .png) to the specific board selected from a 
txt file containg the name of your current pinterest boards you will be able to update this list both internally from the program or editing
the txt file directly.

**mandatory**
1. atleast one board name must be entered in the txt file.
2. create a common folder to save your images in your computer before uploading if you wish to change it everytime you can also do that in
the code.
3. to make this code work make sure of the file and folder name is same as that in your desktop, most importantly double check the path 
of folder before executing the code.
